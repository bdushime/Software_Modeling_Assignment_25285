Gishushu traffic light system has three main states:

Green: When the light is green, cars are allowed to proceed through the intersection. This indicates that traffic can safely move forward.
Yellow: The yellow light indicates that the light is about to turn red. Drivers should begin slowing down and preparing to stop.
Red: The red light means that cars must come to a complete stop and wait for the light to change before proceeding through the intersection.

The state transitions are as follows:

From the initial state to Green: The traffic light cycle begins with the green light, allowing cars to go.
From Green to Yellow: The light turns yellow, indicating that the light is about to turn red and drivers should prepare to stop.
From Yellow to Red: The light turns red, signaling that cars must stop and wait for the light to change.
From Red back to Green: The traffic light cycle repeats, returning to the green state to allow cars to proceed.
